# Data Analysis Bot

## Description

This project is a data analysis bot built in Python. The bot allows users to store information in a text file, which can then be analyzed further using other tools.

## How to Use

To use the bot, simply run the `main.py` script in a Python environment. The bot will prompt you to choose between two options: Store Data and Advanced Commands.

If you choose Store Data, the bot will prompt you to enter the type of information you want to store, and then the information itself. The information will be stored in a file called `data.txt` in the root directory of the project.

If you choose Advanced Commands, the bot will display a message saying that this feature is not currently in use.

To exit the bot at any time, simply type "exit" when prompted for the type of information to store.

## Requirements

To run this bot, you will need Python 3.5 or higher installed on your machine.
